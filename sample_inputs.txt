The first line of input is the number of processes(n), the second line of input is the burst time of n processes and the third line of
input is the arrival time of the processes.
In case of priority scheduling algorithms(both premptive and non-premptive) the fourth line of input contains the priority of n processes
such that lower is the number higher is the priority
In case of round robin scheduling the fourth line of input contains the time quantum.
